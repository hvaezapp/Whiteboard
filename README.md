# WhiteBoard

## Introduction

**WhiteBoard** is a real-time collaborative whiteboard application built with **SignalR** on .NET 9. It enables multiple users to draw, write, and share ideas together on a shared canvas â€” all in real time.

As soon as a user draws or makes changes, updates are instantly broadcast to all connected participants, ensuring a seamless and synchronized collaboration experience. Powered by SignalR, the app offers low-latency, bi-directional communication across clients. This makes WhiteBoard an ideal tool for brainstorming sessions, design discussions, online teaching, or any interactive group activity.

The app supports multiple device connections, allowing users to collaborate from any platform while always staying in sync.
